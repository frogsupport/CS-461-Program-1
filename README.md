## Assignment Info

A Best First Search example in the context of finding a route from one city to another. Given  a set of cities, their coordinates, and their adjacencies find a good route from one to the other. The solution may not be the best one available, however it will be guided by a distance heuristic and so it will give a good guess.

## How to Use

Pull this repo down to your machine and run the `Main.py` file with something that can run python code. Make sure so have the other files in this project in the directory when you do because `Main.py` depends on others.

The program will ask which for a start and end city, make sure to use cities that are listed in the `coordinates.txt` file or the `adjacencies.txt` file, as that is where all the data for this project is coming from. The program will attempt to find a good route for you.
